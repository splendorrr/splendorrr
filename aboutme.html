        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>DORIS ALEKS lives in Boulder. She is the channel between the world of tennis, arts, entertainment, Boulder society. 
			She can tell you everything you need to know about tennis. 
			The way we live. 
			She'll help you connect with tennis people, and with her MBA and MSBA degrees she can help your business. 
			
			Doris started tennis when she was 7 years old. She was an athletic but chubby girl so her dad signed her up for tennis. Her brother, Boris, also played but only recreationally. It's been more than 20 years and she still plays. Doesn't plan on stopping. 
			
			Tennis has helped her meet so many people who have become an important part of my life. She wants to provide that experience to others, and build an amazing tennis community in Boulder. A place where we just go and play. A place that is convenient and we don't have to drive 30 minutes to, after a stressful day or being stuck in traffic...or stuck in snow.
