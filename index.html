		<h1>Tennis in Boulder?</h1>
	<p>	
Yes, please. With the closure of my second home Rocky Mountain Tennis Center, I wanted to build a tennis court where I can play...but also my friends. So, here it is :) Oh, also anyone is welcome. You don't have to be a member. You don't have to be my friend. But if you are coming to play here, it means you're cool and we can be friends. Jokes aside, I wish you a warm welcome and have fun. 
  </p>

 <p> This is your place to relax and enjoy the game!
